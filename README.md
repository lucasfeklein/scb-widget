## Project Development

The Smart Chatbot project is a comprehensive solution that leverages advanced technologies to provide a seamless and efficient experience for both website owners and their visitors. Here's an overview of the key components and technologies used in its development:

### Frontend

The frontend of the Smart Chatbot is built using Next.js, a popular React framework. Next.js offers a robust foundation for building interactive and fast web applications. It allows for server-side rendering, optimized routing, and a smooth user experience.

### Backend

The backend of the Smart Chatbot is integrated with several essential services to ensure its functionality and security:

- **Stripe Integration**: It was incorporated Stripe, a widely trusted payment processing platform, to handle transactions and payments.

- **Magic Link Authentication**: The authentication system is fortified with Magic Link authentication. Magic links are secure and user-friendly, allowing clients to access their accounts with a simple click on a link sent to their email address.

- **Database**: We utilize a robust database system to store and manage client information securely. This ensures that data is readily accessible for the Chatbot's intelligent responses while adhering to strict data protection standards.

### Chat Widget

To make the integration process as effortless as possible, it was developed a user-friendly chat widget. Website owners can easily embed this widget onto their websites by adding a simple script tag. This widget provides visitors with direct access to the Smart Chatbot, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

With the Smart Chatbot, we aim to provide a comprehensive and AI-powered solution that not only automates responses but also enhances the overall user experience on your website. Whether you're looking to streamline customer interactions, handle payments, or store client data securely, our project has you covered.
